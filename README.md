## Introduction

The Student Performance Prediction project aims to predict the math scores of students based on various demographic and educational factors. By analyzing a dataset containing information such as gender, ethnicity, parental education level, lunch type, and test preparation course completion, the project seeks to provide insights into the factors influencing student performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about students' demographics, such as gender, ethnicity, parental education level, as well as factors like lunch type and completion of test preparation courses. It also includes students' math scores.

## Project Goals

The main goals of the Student Performance Prediction project are as follows:

- **Data Exploration:** Conduct exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution of various features and their correlations with math scores.
- **Feature Engineering:** Create new features or transform existing ones to improve the predictive power of the model.
- **Model Development:** Build machine learning models to predict math scores based on the available features.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of the models using appropriate metrics and techniques, such as cross-validation.
- **Insights Generation:** Extract insights from the models to understand the factors that influence student performance.

## Technologies Used

The project leverages the following technologies:

- **Python:** Programming language used for data analysis, modeling, and visualization.
- **Pandas:** Data manipulation library used for handling the dataset.
- **Scikit-learn:** Machine learning library used for model development and evaluation.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn:** Visualization libraries used for data visualization.
- **Flask** A lightweight webframework in Python
